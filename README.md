# Backtracking and Local Search

In order to run this program you will need:<br>
- Five files (all included in the repo):<br>
  - mapcolor.py
  - utilityfuncs.py
  - backtrack.py
  - local.py
  - usmap.txt
- Python 3.7 installed (I used this for my dev environment, other versions
may work, so use other versions at your own risk)

Next use this command in the shell / terminal to execute the python code<br>
> python mapcolor.py usmap.txt<br>

### Backtracking Search
The assignment of colors to the states and the number of nodes
searched will display in the console

### Local Search
If search completes successfully, the assignment of colors to
the states and the number of changes made will be printed to the
console. If not solution is found, a node that the search could 
not complete will be printed to the console
